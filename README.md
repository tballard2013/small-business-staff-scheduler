# small-business-staff-scheduler


The idea. 
- Create a simple, free online tool to help a friend with scheduling their staff weekly.
- The client owns their own data (no back end?)

Why an app instead of a spreadsheet or something custom?
- Help new business folks get their scheduling up and running quickly
- Assume mistakes are part of the process, so avoiding laborious initial setup is a goal to help users iterate while they find their businesses sweet spot.
- The app could be a basic single page app using browser features to help store short cuts.
- The app should help hint through the steps.

Basic run down.

- Define business name (in case you want to do different schedules)
- Define the roles that need staffing
- Define the days of the week for those roles
- Define the start and stop hours for the days for those roles
- Month, Year roll ups (does the week represent the base case for months and years... and how do deal with holidays, vacation, sick time, shift-trades)

Example.

Burger-joint.
- Cook (M, T, W, Th, F) 9AM - 9PM
- Cashier (M, T, W, Th, F) 9AM - 9PM
- Manager/Floater/Backup coverage (M, T, W, Th, F) 9AM - 9PM
